To install plugins, open up Sublime Text 2 and then go to Preferences->Browse packages.

Open the User package, and place the plugin .py file there.

Run plugins via view.run_command('command_name') in Sublime Text console, or create your own keybinding.

If the plugin class is CommandNameCommand, then the name is 'command_name'.
